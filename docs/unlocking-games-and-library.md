Before downloading in Steam, lock the game version to prevent Steam from auto-updating it to an incompatible version:

```
SUO > Tools > Game Auto Update > click Open > Smart Apply
```

!!! info "Default state"
    By default, games are already in **Lock** mode.  
    **Disable = Lock** | **Enable = Unlock**

## ⚠ 32-Hour Cooldown
 
!!! warning "Applies to Denuvo, Hypervisor, Online Patch & Bypass Games Only"
    Games that fall under **Denuvo**, **Hypervisor**, **Online Patch**, or **Bypass** categories are locked behind a **32-hour waiting period** after purchase before you can access and play them.
 
    - The 32-hour lock starts from the moment your purchase is confirmed
    - You will not be able to play these games until the 32 hours have passed
    - This is by design and cannot be bypassed or shortened
 
!!! info "Regular games are not affected"
    Games that do not require Denuvo, Hypervisor, Online Patch, or Bypass can be unlocked and played without any cooldown restriction.

Right-clicking a game in the **Steam Library** opens Steam's context menu with these options:

---

### Browse Local Files

Opens the game's installation folder in Windows Explorer. Useful for:

- Manually running `.bat` or `.exe` files (e.g. `HV-PlugNPlay.bat`, `HV-Launcher.bat`)
- Checking if bypass or patch files are present
- Troubleshooting missing files

---

### Verify Integrity of Game Files
<img width="282" height="56" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5515d47a-b1c3-4cd2-83e3-8cb160d06db5" />

Steam checks all game files and re-downloads any that are missing or corrupted.

!!! warning
    Do **not** use Verify Integrity after applying a bypass or online patch. Steam will detect the patched files as modified and replace them with the original versions, removing your patch. You will need to re-apply the patch afterwards.

---

### Uninstall

Uninstalls the game from your PC. The game will remain in your Steam library and can be re-downloaded at any time.

!!! note
    Uninstalling does not remove the game from ONENNABE. Your unlock is still active — just re-download and re-apply the patch if needed.
